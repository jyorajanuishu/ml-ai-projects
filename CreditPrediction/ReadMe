Upgrad Hackathon - Credit Prediction
Feb 2020

The purpose of the Hackathon was to be able to predict the credit amount given a set of features like Account information, Loan duration, Purpose of load, Credit amount, Kind of propery owned, Employment status, Residential status, etc.

Exploratory data analysis and subsequent data cleaning was done.
Univariate and Bivariate Segmented analysis revealed how some of the features affected the credit amount in the Bar Graphs and Pait Plots created.
Data cleaning and data processing was done. Dummy variables were created for the categorical features.

A heat map showed no correlation among the features and hence PCA was not done to reduce the dimensionality as this could lead to information loss.

A Random forest regressor and an Artificial Neural Network have been tried out as the models for prediction. The standard scaling was used for the data.

In the Random Forest Regressor, a grid search with a set of hyper-parameters was executed to get the optimal set of hyper-parameters.
Hyper-parameters selected were number of trees, maximum features to be selected in each sample in the ensemble, maximum depth and maximum samples in leaf nodes.

The Neural network architecture consisted of 7 Dense layers - 64-32-32-32-32-16-1
For handling overfitting, 3 Drop out layers and L1_L2 regularizers were used. Loss function used was the Root Mean Squared Error

The performance metric was Normalized Root Mean Square Error which came out as 97.6%
